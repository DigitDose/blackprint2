Create unique clothes with us and stand out from the crowd!

What is screen printing - it is a printing technique in which an image is transferred to a surface using a special mesh stencil.

Silk screen printing is suitable for T-shirts, posters, labels, packaging and many other advertising materials. An ideal choice for large and small print runs with high printing accuracy and image durability.

Technical process/main stages:

1. Stencil preparation - a light-sensitive emulsion is applied to a frame with a thin mesh stretched over it, which hardens under the influence of a powerful light source.
2. Exposure - A special film with an image is placed on the stencil and this structure is exposed to a light source. The emulsion hardens in those places where light hits, and those parts where light does not hit the film remain soft.
3. Stencil development - after exposure, the stencil is washed with water under high pressure. The uncured emulsion is washed off, leaving areas on the mesh through which the paint will be pressed.
4. Printing - The stencil is fixed on a special printing machine, and the paint is applied to the mesh by pressing with a special squeegee.
5. Drying - the finished product is placed in a special drying tunnel and under the influence of high temperatures, the image hardens on the surface.

** Advantages of screen printing:

▪ High brightness and color saturation: Due to the density of the paint, the colors are saturated and bright.
▪ Allows you to create detailed drawings and images.
▪ Durability - images are resistant to wear and fading compared to other printing techniques.
▪ Allows you to use special effect paints (for example, metallic, luminous, light-accumulative, UV, glitter, etc.).
▪ Great for large and small print runs.
▪ The image is more resistant to washing and much more pleasant to the touch compared to other types of printing.
▪ Wide range of materials: the method allows you to print on various materials, such as textiles, metal, plastic, glass, paper, etc.

|▪ SCREENPRINTING INKS ▪ |
 ------------------------

** Water-Based Inks:
1. Environmentally Friendly: Water-based inks are generally safer for the environment and health since they do not contain toxic solvents and chemical additives.
2. Easy to Apply: Water-based inks are easy to apply to fabric and dry quickly, making the screen printing process more efficient.
3. Transparency: They have good transparency, allowing colors to be mixed and created in various shades and effects.
4. Good Penetration: Water-based inks can penetrate the fabric well, creating an even coating and maintaining the natural look of the material.


** Plastisol Inks:
1. High Wash Fastness: Plastisol inks are highly resistant to washing and wear, making them an ideal choice for creating durable and high-quality designs on garments.
2. Vivid and Rich Colors: Plastisol inks generally provide vibrant and rich colors, making it possible to create expressive and contrasting designs.
3. High precision and clarity: Plastisol paints provide good precision and clarity even in small details, making them an excellent choice for complex and detailed designs. 4. Wide range of textures and effects: Plastisol paints are available in a variety of textures and effects, such as glitter, flock, relief and others, allowing you to create unique and original designs.

-------------------------------------------------------
We combine manual printing and automatic printing types:
-------------------------------------------------------
** Hand Printing.

Advantages of Hand Printing:

Great for unique and creative projects, limited editions.

1. Flexibility and Creativity: Hand printing allows for creativity and a personalized approach to each product. This allows for the creation of unique, hand-made drawings and designs.
2. Variety of Textures and Effects: With hand printing, you can easily experiment with different textures, effects, and shades, allowing for more original and interesting pieces.
3. Suitable for Small Orders: Hand printing is ideal for small runs or orders with limited time, as it does not require a large investment in equipment and preparation.

Disadvantages:
1. Time and Labor Intensive: Hand printing can be more time-consuming and labor-intensive than automated methods. This can increase the lead time and production costs.
2. Unevenness: With hand printing, it is difficult to achieve perfect uniformity of ink application to the fabric, which may result in some imperfections in the final product.
3. Limited Productivity: Manual printing is generally less productive than automated methods, making it less suitable for large orders or serial production.



** Automatic Printing.

Great for high volume advertising projects.

Advantages:
1. High productivity: Automatic printing provides high speed and efficiency, allowing you to process large volumes of orders in a short time.
2. High accuracy and uniformity: Automated systems typically provide more accurate and uniform application of ink to the fabric, ensuring a higher quality end product.
3. Less labor costs: Using automated systems can reduce labor costs and reduce the risk of human error.

Disadvantages:
1. Less design flexibility: Unlike manual printing, automated systems may be less flexible in creating unique and customized designs, as they are focused on mass production.

|▪ PROJECT REQUIREMENTS ▪ |
 -------------------------

VECTOR – Illustrator – *.AI *.PDF
A vector graphic is artwork made up of points, lines, and curves that are based upon mathematical equations, rather than a solid colored square pixels. This means that no matter how large or small or how close you zoom in on the image, the lines, curves, and points remain smooth.

RASTER – Adobe Photoshop – *.PSD *.PDF
Raster artwork is any digital art composed of horizontal and vertical rows of pixels. As a result, when raster images are enlarged, the image quality diminishes significantly. Typical raster file types include .psd, .tif, .jpg, .gif, and .png. All Photoshop files MUST be of high quality and a minimum of 300 DPI.

----

Artwork Checklist:
- Artwork should be sent 100% black and white. (The black will be what’s printed)
- Verify your artwork is set at the actual size you want it printed.
- Make sure your .psd, .pdf, or .bmp file has a resolution of at least 300dpi.
- All text layers should be rasterized or converted to outlines.
- Multi-color images should have each color on a separate layer.

Acceptable Formats:
.bmp
.ai
.psd
.eps
.pdf
.png

----
*.JPG *.BMP are NOT acceptable file formats.

Along with the customer, wants the highest quality product and unfortunately these types of files do not fit the minimum requirements.
----


If your artwork is hand drawn or scanned make sure it is of high quality (300 dpi or higher) and scaled to the desired print size.

Note : Usually this type of artwork needs some cleaning up to be acceptable for printing. If this is the case and the project is simple enough, we will work on preparing your illustration to the best of your preference. If the artwork needs extensive work we will not accept the project.
